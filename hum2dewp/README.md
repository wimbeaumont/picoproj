 this is a project where the pico is used to get the humidity and the temperature from a HTM2500LF sensor and calculates the dewpoint
 
 It is used in a  box where the temperature is lowered to -35 C  , dry air is flushed in.  But condensation has to be avoided. So the (box temperature - dewpoint) should be greated than 10
 
 It assumes the pico C sdk is setup as indicated in the RADME.md file of this repository 
 
   * build  place holder for the files generated during the cmake and make process
   * CMakeLists.txt  cmake file to build the  firmware 
   * fitNTC.py  program for getting the NTC parameters used in calculating the temperature from the NTC 
   * hum2dewp.cpp the main program 
   * pico_sdk_import.cmake needed for the SDK calls 
   * include    header files
